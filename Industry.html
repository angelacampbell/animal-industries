  <h1 style = "color:CornFLowerblue;"> Industry Exposed </h1>
<p>Animals are living beings that are residents of this planet just like us. They are prone to horrible mistreatment based on the pure fact that they cannot communicate with us. These vulnerable beings are held captive against their will and tested on, used for show, eaten and even worn.</p>
<p>  <h2 style = "color:DarkMagenta;" >Fashion industry: </h2>
The fashion industry exploits innocent animals for their fur and leather.
Some companies go as far as taking snake skin in for their own benefit.
People avoid the truth behind how these products are accumulated.
The horrible truth is that these animals are kept in small confined spaces with enough room for only a few steps to be taken.
Animals are tortured and abused.
In addition to the pain and suffering animals have to go through, the production of these materials contributes to climate change.
Leather production uses  chemicals in the tanning process which increases the carbon footprint.
Raising animals for their fur also pollutes the air.
 In Denmark, where more than 19 million minks are killed for their fur each year, more than 8,000 pounds of ammonia are released into the atmosphere annually.
Animals are skinned alive and visually distressed.
This should not have to happen when alternatives are available to prevent the cruelty of this industry.
Brands such as Gucci have vowed to go fur free, but still sell a variety of leather products which continue to contribute to the torture of reptiles and certain farm animals.
Avoid funding this industry by opting to purchase faux fur and faux leather.

<p><h2 style= "color:HotPink;" >Animal Testing: </h2> Animals in the testing industry are forced to undergo traumatizing tests that harm them physically and emotionally.
They become distressed throughout these tests and ultimately are killed after tests are done being conducted.
Throughout tests, animals are injected with and force fed harmful substances, exposed to radiation, forced to undergo unnecessary surgeries that can cause long lasting damage, stressed and subjected to situations that provoke anxiety and depression and are forced to inhale toxic gases.
On top of everything, animals are given terrible conditions to live in for the time of their tests.
They are thrown in cages and denied freedom of movement.
Other times, animals are isolated and denied the company of other animals.
To avoid funding such a cruel industry, you can opt to purchase cruelty free items.

  <h2 style = "color:Lightcyan;"> Circus industry: </h2>

  <p>Animals are forced to perform acts with consequences if they do not comply.
    This is seen at circuses where elephants, tigers and other animals are trained to jump through hoops, balance on pedestals and other cruel tricks.
    This is because they are traumatized after being abused with whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, and
bullhooks (heavy batons with a sharp steel hook at the end). Training sessions are not monitored by the government, so trainers can freely get away with the abuse that goes on behind closed doors, especially because they are cautious at shows. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWlFDD9-QpM&has_verified=1"> Carson & Barnes Circus: Cruelty Under the Big Top. </a> Additionally, circuses travel year-round in all types of weather conditions. Animals are confined to small cages in which they must stay for hours or days depending on where they are headed to. Animals may not have access to basic necessities throughout travel time because of confinement. Once animals reach their venue, they are immediately chained in arena basements and parking lots. The distress caused by the snapping whips, shackles, etc. leads animals to run away in hopes to find refuge. One prime example is Tyke the elephant. Tyke was a female African bush elephant from Mozambique who performed with Circus International of Honolulu, Hawaii. On August 20, 1994 during a performance in which she killed her trainer and injured her groomer. She ran through the streets of the Kakaâ€™ako central business for over thirty minutes until she was eventually shot down by local police. </p>
