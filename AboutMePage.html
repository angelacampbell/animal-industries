<h1 style = "color:LightGoldenRodYellow;"> About Me </h1>
<p> I am a sixteen year old girl and around three years ago I made the decision to cut meat out of my life completely
Recently I have gone vegan because I found out the truth behind the dairy industry and no longer wanted to contribute to it.
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QftuC3IrFCE"> The Truth About the Milk Industry. </a>
On top of avoiding food products with dairy or meat, I avoid clothing products with fur or leather, I purchase vegan friendly soaps, shampoos, makeup products, etc.
I also make sure that these products are not tested on animals.
Additionally, I avoid circuses with animals because I do not have the heart to pay these people to treat the animals terribly.
